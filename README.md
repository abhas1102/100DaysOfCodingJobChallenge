# 100DaysOfJobChallenge
This is a challenge to crack a decent coding job in next 100 days.

Starting with day 1, there are 5 components I am going to focus on.
1. Android project particularly in Jetpack compose
2. Data structure in Kotlin
3. Backend development following a Coursera course
4. Understanding of version control system
5. Study of coding interview questions

For next 15 days, I am going to focus 1/2 hour each in a day. And I will post the updates of each day in a folder created day wise in this repository.
